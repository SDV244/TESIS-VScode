# TESIS-VScode
This repo is part of a deliverable for our Thesis project, the intention is to find the model which performs better in a multilabel classification problem for anuran calls.
By using transfer learning and tuning hyperparameters.
The models decided to train for this application are: MobileNet, DenseNet121, ResNet50, Inception V3
